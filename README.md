Smart Bike Project 
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Smart Bike Project, 
where an ordinary bicycle has been transformed into a feature-packed smart bike. 
The project integrates advanced electronics and smart features into the bike's frame, making it both practical and fun to use.


Key Features
90 Addressable LEDs:

Customizable lighting effects for enhanced visibility and aesthetics.
Controlled via the Arduino for dynamic animations and patterns.

Accelerometer Integration:
Detects motion and orientation for smart light adjustments and potential safety features.

Remote Key Access:
A car-style remote key system for locking and unlocking the bike.

Security System:
Anti-theft alarm and locking mechanisms integrated into the bike.

Arduino-Controlled:
Centralized control for all smart features using an Arduino microcontroller.

Fully Integrated Frame:
All components are discreetly housed inside the bike's frame, preserving its sleek design.
